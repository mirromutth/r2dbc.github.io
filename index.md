R2DBC is an endeavor to bring a reactive programming API to relational data stores. It was first announced at SpringOne Platform 2018, as shown in the keynote below:

From the same conference, see Ben Hale go into details of what reactive relational access means. Also discover what it's like to build [clients](/clients) and [drivers](/drivers):

* **Reactive Streams** - R2DBC is founded on **Reactive Streams** providing an **asynchronous**, **non-blocking** API.
* **Relational Databases** - R2DBC engages **relational** databases with a **reactive API**, something not possible with the blocking nature of JDBC and JPA.
* **Scalable Solutions** - Reactive Streams makes it possible to move from the classic one thread per connection approach to a more **powerful**, more **scalable** approach.

# Relational meets Reactive

People wanting to scale while retaining usage of relational databases are cut off from reactive programming due to existing standards. R2DBC introduces a new API that allows asynchronous, non-blocking code that work efficiently with relational databases.

# Cloud Ready

R2DBC supports [cloud native](https://pivotal.io/cloud-native) apps where relational databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and others are found. Have the freedom to pick the right one for the job and not be confined by API.

# Community

While led by members of the Spring team at Pivotal, R2DBC depends upon **community support**. Contributors from all relational data stores are invited to participate in building a reactive, relational future.
