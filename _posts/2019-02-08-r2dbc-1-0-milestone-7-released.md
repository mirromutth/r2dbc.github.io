Greetings R2DBC community!

We are delighted to announce the availability of R2DBC 1.0.0.M7, the seventh milestone release. 
The release is available from [https://repo.spring.io/milestone/](https://repo.spring.io/milestone/) and ships with a few new modules:
**R2DBC Proxy** and a Bill of Materials.

Introducing the Bill of Materials (bom) simplifies version management and consumption.
Each project has its own theme how it names release trains. Want to hear a bit of trivia?
We love Italy. We love the [Dolomites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolomites) and so name our release trains after Dolomiti towns. The first release train is named: [Arabba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabba). So let us introduce you to `Arabba-M7`.

We are also excited to announce that this is the first release shipping with [R2DBC Proxy](https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-proxy)  covering a multitude of use cases that are solved best with decoration: Tracing, Metrics, Observability. 

The release train ships with the following modules:
* R2DBC SPI (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-spi`, `io.r2dbc:r2dbc-spi-test`)
* R2DBC Client (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-client`)
* R2DBC PostgreSQL driver (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-postgresql`)
* R2DBC H2 driver (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-h2`)
* R2DBC Microsoft SQL Server driver (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-mssql`)

New modules in this release:
* R2DBC Proxy (`io.r2dbc.r2dbc-proxy`)
* R2DBC BOM (`io.r2dbc.r2dbc-bom`)

Most notable SPI changes are: 

* Reinstated generated value (key) retrieval (`Statement.returnGeneratedValues(â€¦)`) that moves key generation back to the driver.
* Improved support for column metadata (`ColumnMetadata`).
* Add support for `ConnectionFactory` discovery allowing connection creation without using driver-specific API.
* R2DBC ships with specification documentation.
